# Analogue Clock
Scrimba Weekly Web Dev Challenge - Analogue Clock

One of Scrimba's Weekly Web Dev Challenges to build a working clock.

Using the JavaScript Date methods, I was able to retrieve the current time. Then, some calculations to work out the initial position of each of the three hands based on the time in hours, minutes and seconds.

A setInterval() function set to run every 1s means that the clock keeps time.
